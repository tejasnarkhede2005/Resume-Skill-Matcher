# Resume-Skill-Matcher

I built a Resume Skill Matcher using Python and Streamlit. The app extracts text from resumes, processes job descriptions using NLP and regex, calculates a skill match percentage, and suggests missing skills. It’s designed for recruiters and job seekers and focuses on clean UI and real-world relevance.
